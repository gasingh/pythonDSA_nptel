## Course layout
### Week 1
- Informal introduction to programming, algorithms and data structures via gcd
- Downloading and installing Python
- gcd in Python: variables, operations, control flow - assignments, condition-als, loops, functions

### Week 2
- Python: types, expressions, strings, lists, tuples
- Python memory model: names, mutable and immutable values
- List operations: slices etc
- Binary search
- Inductive function denitions: numerical and structural induction
- Elementary inductive sorting: selection and insertion sort
- In-place sorting

### Week 3
- Basic algorithmic analysis: input size, asymptotic complexity, O() notation
- Arrays vs lists
- Merge sort
- Quicksort
- Stable sorting

### Week 4
- Dictionaries
- More on Python functions: optional arguments, default values
- Passing functions as arguments
- Higher order functions on lists: map, lter, list comprehension

### Week 5
- Exception handling
- Basic input/output
- Handling files
- String processing

### Week 6
- Backtracking: N Queens, recording all solutions
- Scope in Python: local, global, nonlocal names
- Nested functions
- Data structures: stack, queue
- Heaps

### Week 7
- Abstract datatypes
- Classes and objects in Python
- "Linked" lists: find, insert, delete
- Binary search trees: find, insert, delete
- Height-balanced binary search trees

### Week 8
